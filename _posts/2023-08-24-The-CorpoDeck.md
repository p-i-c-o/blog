Welcome to the first post on the CorpoDeck Project!

## What is the CorpoDeck?
The CorpoDeck is a mix between a cyberdeck and a briefcase (hence the word 
corporate). It will be a briefcase for the average business mans 
shenanigans (i.e. paperwork, files, pens, etc...) but also contain a fully 
functional computer.

## Specs?
I have a Raspberry Pi 3b+, I am going to upgrade this later on though. A 
10'000 mAh powerbank will power it and the screen. Though the powebank 
gives me 8 hours or so of battery life, it is quite bulky and it could be 
changed later on.

## Software?
I am considering keeping Raspberry Pi OS, as Ubuntu Desktop is a bit too 
heavy for my RPi 3b+ (it struggles to open the app menu).

## Conclusion
The CorpoDeck will be my project for the next few months, so please feel 
free to contact me and suggest ideas!

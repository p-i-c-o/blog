Streaming services nowadays are very expensive, and most of the time, don't even have good movies!
I'm here to help with that.

## Torrents
Torrents are files that point to other files, most people use them for movies and tv-shows, but you can find a torrent for practically anthing.
### The Pirate Bay
My favourite website is [The Pirate Bay Proxy List](https://www.proxythepiratebay.org/). To download a movie, go on this website and select a good website with good connection, for me [this one](https://piratesbay.tk/) seems to work the best. Then enter your search term, your type of content using the checkboxes, and click search! I recommend you click the magnet icon. It'll bring you to another page. Click "Start Torrent", then download the files you want! Enjoy!

## The lazier way out
Streaming sites, as mentioned before are behind a paywall most times, but here are some that aren't. And reliable of course, not those shitty ad spam ones.
### movie-web
[movie-web.app](https://movie-web.app/search/movie) is my personal favourite for quick streaming. You can simply search for a movie, and watch it! You can also download movies on it by clicking the cogwheel then clicking download.

It will bring you to another video player, but simply click the 3 dots in the bottom right corner and click download.

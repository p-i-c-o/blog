Tails is the spies OS, it simply leaves no traces!

## What is Tails?
Tails is an operating system that has a bunch of usefull apps 
preinstalled, boots via USB, and is only located on RAM when used. That 
means you can use Tails to safely access the internet from anywhere 
without having to leave traces on your computer! Each time the computer 
shuts down, the RAM is automatically emptied! According to [the Tails 
website](https://www.tails.net), the computer automatically erases:

- Websites that you visited, even in private mode
- Files that you opened, even if you deleted them
- Passwords, even if you use a password manager
- All the devices and Wi-Fi networks that you used


## How do I use Tails?
Tails is very simple to use! Simply have these things:
- Balena Etcher (one use only)
- Minimum 8GB USB Drive (this is where you'll install Tails)
- The Tails ISO

Step 1:
Simply etch the Tails IMG onto the USB Drive

Step 2:
Shutdown your computer

Step 3:
Boot into the USB drive on startup

Step 4:
Surf the web safely!


## Why would I use Tails?

[The Tails website](https://www.tails.net) tells us that Tails can be used 
for:

- Activists
Activists use Tails to hide their identities, avoid censorship, and 
communicate securely.

- Journalists and their sources
Journalists and their sources use Tails to publish sensitive information 
and access the Internet from unsafe places.

- Domestic violence survivors
Domestic violence survivors use Tails to escape surveillance at home.

- You
You whenever you need extra privacy in this digital world.


With all that said, Tails is the perfect OS for anyone requiring amazing 
security and secrecy. I recommend everyone to have a USB drive with it 
installed!
